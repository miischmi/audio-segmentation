# Background
This work contributes to the automatic segmentation of opera recordings in audio file format through audio analysis based on segmented reference recordings by synchronization and matching procedures. This segmentation tool was developed for the project "Opera forever" of the Bern University of the Arts (HKB) as part of a paper in the bachelor's degree program in business information technologies (Bsc WI). Detailed information can be found at http://make.opendata.ch/wiki/project:opera_forever
